    <p>
      Healthy food is delicious. Doing sport is enjoyable. You just need to
      start - people said. Nonsense! - I thought. To me, a 19-year-old guy,
      overweight and depressed, who ate tons of junk food to seize the stress,
      those healthy-life-gurus sounded like aliens coming from another planet.
      On their planet, it must have sounded right. On my planet, eating pizza
      was OK and jogging was exhausting. 12 years later, after I shed almost 100
      pounds and completely changed my diet, I still believe we WERE on
      different planets. The thing is that once I escaped.

      Now I'm a coach with 7+ years of experience who founded the chain of sport
      clubs each having a fitness bar and assistance of psychologists, and
      dietitians. I'm sure that nothing will work until you know where you are
      and where you go. Possibly, you are now on the planet Fatness and want to
      escape it. Here I am to show you the way out. The gym itself is the
      spacecraft for you to reach a happy new life, with its fitness bars to
      adapt your body to new conditions and with friendly crew to motivate you
      and help on your way.
