        Healthy food is delicious. Doing sport is enjoyable. You just need to
        start - people said. Nonsense! - I thought. To me, a 19-year-old guy,
        overweight and depressed, who ate tons of junk food to seize the stress,
        those healthy-life-gurus sounded like aliens coming from another planet.
        On their planet, it must have sounded right. On my planet, eating pizza
        was OK and jogging was exhausting. 12 years later, after I shed almost
        100 pounds and completely changed my diet, I still believe we WERE on
        different planets. The thing is that once I escaped.

          How to stop doubting and start exercising regularly
        </h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          Thousands of people dream about having a nice body. They start doing
          sport, face challenges and quit it in a few weeks or even days. Why
          does it happen? The problem is that people often do too much physical
          activity when their body is not ready for this load. Without allowing
          any recovery time between exercise sessions, they get tired quickly
          and lose motivation. We believe that you should have a smooth start
          and focus on developing a habit of doing sport regularly. So, we offer
          you a few training programs for beginners.
